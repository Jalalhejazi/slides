# mvc business

- backbone + underscore (requires a dom framework)
- emberjs

<blockquote>75kb jquery + 15 kb jam required js libs to get off the ground. Need I go on? Performance is a nightmare. Ui parity is not hard. Spend a few hours and get a 300-400 line ui lib written yourself and you will do way better. - Fil Maj, Apache Cordova JS Lead at Adobe</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have had zero issues with jQM. + using jQM offers the best chance of UI reuse across platforms. My advice is to use jQM, if you are going to use a UI framework. - Jesse MacFadyen, Apache Cordova Windows Phone Lead at Adobe</blockquote>

<blockquote>We need to stop building things for developer convenience and instead build them for user experience. We can create rich experiences that solve these problems. Limitations can fuel creativity. Donâ€™t get tied to particular solutions, revisit things that we previously dismissed. South Street is an umbrella project form the Filament Group that addressed problems around qualified application of features & improving delivery mechanisms. - http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1565</blockquote>

<blockquote>And my advice is to not complain about performance if you use a general purpose UI Framework. The main performance problem is in interaction delays (which is perceived performance. The same as how 150ms is snappy and 300ms is slow). - Mike Brooks, Apache Cordova Docs Lead at Adobe</blockquote>

# this is not a benchmark 

- avoiding synthetic benchmarks
- remember user perception is best measured with real live ppl
- startup performance is an interesting indicator but hardly an absolute

# sencha app build production

- resolves dependencies and  only including exactly what is used for optimal file size / performance
- appcache douchebagger removed
- minify js and css
- js and css stored inside localStorage on first load, and patches them via delta updates between releases

---

# conclusions

1. sencha while heaviest has the most mature tooling; really thinks through perf practices (has to...)
2. zepto + underscore + backbone trinity easily the smallest; but does nothing for your UI
3. jQuery dependant frameworks somewhere in-between

# the setup

- platforms I am interested in: ios, android, blackberry, windows phone 
- browser insances I am interested in: stock browser, opera, firefox, chrome
- lets treat hybrid environments like phonegap seperatly

# basically the two best appcach protips ever 

- jake archibald is hilarious and accurate in his hate on appcache
- lyza danger gardner saved my sanity with chrome://appcache-internals/
