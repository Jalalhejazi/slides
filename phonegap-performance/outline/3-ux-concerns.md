# UX Concerns

# A great experience can be created with any technology

## and so can a bad one

---

# The Uncanny Valley

- emulating native controls bad
- observing native patterns is good

---

# there is no one true way

- saying one approach is better is naive and ultimately harmful
- tradeoffs are observed with any technology choice

---

# Great UX is Details

---

# Great UX is Goal Directed NOT Tech Directed

---

# UX is ALWAYS iterative

---

# Your Brand is not Apple Widgets

---

# native gui is lowest common denomenator

- one platform is not a platform: it is a proprietary runtime
- designing for native is the modern equiv of designing for outlook express

---

# perf today is not a indication of perf tmrw

## ...just ask javascript

---

<blockquote>the web is a self healing system - james pearce, facebook</blockquote>

---

# UX is too important to treat like an aesthetic

- urls count
- accessability counts
- standards prevent lock-in

---

# proprietary lock-in is a performance antipattern

- impedes competition
- impedes portabilty by nature
- blocks ability to move to better service providers
