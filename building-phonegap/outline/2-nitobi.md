Around this time we start talking about "the github model".

<aside class=notes>
    - Open source all IP possible to facilitate adoption, community, and thus ecosystem, growth.
    - Make an easy to use hosted service for the completely free IP and charge for it.
    - Couple with additional revenue streams from enterprise installations, partnering, support, consulting, and training.

### PhoneGap 0.8.0+, approved by Apple for AppStore

<img width=650 style=background:none;border:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none src=img/reject.png>

<aside class=notes>
    - a tonne of ppl where submitting apps named PhoneGap to apple
    - they began rejecting us
    - we only used public apis; they thought we were compiling our own browser
    - after a few weeks of back and forth they gave our src the thumbs up

# Cadence

<img src=img/metronome.jpeg>

<a href=http://phonegap.com/2012/04/12/rolling-releases-how-apache-cordova-becomes-phonegap-and-why/>Get on the release train.</a>

<aside class=notes>
    - we follow the class MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH system
    - we aim to ship a MINOR every month
    - we ship a PATCH if we fuck up the MINOR
    - we ship a MAJOR every July
    - we deprecate violently, but retrain support for 6 months, semversioning makes no sense
</aside>

# Release Train Benefits

- Dates no longer slip; we move bugs to the next release.
- Bug response time blazing fast.

# What about Marketing?

<img src=img/wtfguy.jpeg>

<aside class=notes>
    - By this point I was personally averaging 2 presentations a month. Never turned one down unless I was prebooked.
    - The larger community was blogging, tweeting, and responding for us.
    - The message of our goals was a powerful unifying force.
    - newsletter, featured apps and case studies are key materials
    - press releases are a waste of money/time
    - indy confs are the way to create buzz
</aside>

# Services

# Support

<img style=background:none;border:none;-webkit-box-shadow:none src=img/internet-bro-fist.png>

<aside class=notes>
    - same as dev except structured and limited
    - basically worked out the same price
    - more contractually binding
    - should have done this right away
</aside>

---

# Training

<img src=img/mind-meld.jpeg>

<aside class=notes>
    - tough going but was our secret weapon for marketing
    - tell the SARS story

</aside>
